# Google Capstone Project (Cyclistic)
I worked on the Google Data Analytics Capstone Projects involved a company named Cyclists, For this project I followed the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
## Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share
company in Chicago. 

Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand
tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike.The director of
marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and
annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. 

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to
broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the
flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

## Ask
Business Question: How do annual members and casual
riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Business Task: Devising a strategy to convert casual users to annual members.

Key Stakeholder: Lily Moreno, Director of Marketing.
